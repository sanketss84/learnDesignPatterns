**Abstract Factory**

Definition:
Providing an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

Straight Talk
A factory [factory method] is responsible for creating objects.
Ultimately a factory for creating other factories

Its like the factory method pattern but everything is encapsulated, its a higher level of abstraction 
using interfaces and abstract classes.
